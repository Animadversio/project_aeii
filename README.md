# Contribute a new language support

Follow the steps below to contribute a new language support:

1. Fork the project to your repository.
2. Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and check out the forked project.
3. Find your country's locale ID from [JDK 6 and JRE 6 Supported Locales](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/locales-137662.html).
4. Grab a TrueType font which supports your country's language, put it under `project_aeii/android/assets/fonts/`. We recommend that you rename the font's filename to your country's locale ID.
5. Go to `project_aeii/android/assets/lang/`, duplicate `en_US.dat` file, rename it to your country's locale ID and translate all the texts after `=`. Note that for the first line, just change `en_US.ttf` to the font filename you are using.
6. Save the language file in UTF-8 format and you are done. Submit a pull request and we will add you to credits once your changes are merged.

**Note:** if you want to see how the font looks in the game, please check the following section.

# Compile & run the project

This project is being developed using [IntellilJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), however if you're planning to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) it will also be fine.
Check out the project from your Github repository after forking it. If you have already checked out the project using Github Desktop then simply import the project from your local repository.
After gradle build is done go for `Build -> Make Project`. Then you can create launchers to launch the game.

* Desktop Launcher **main class:** `net.toyknight.aeii.desktop.DesktopLauncher`, **module:** `desktop`, **working directory:** `<project directory>\project_aeii\android\assets`
* Android Launcher **module:** `android`.
* iOS Launcher **main class:** `net.toyknight.aeii.IOSLauncher`, **module:** `ios`.

**Note:** You will need to run gradle task `desktop:dist` before launch desktop version.

In the Desktop branch, you should launch the compiled `jar` file with these options

* Desktop Launcher **main class:** `net.toyknight.aeii.desktop.DesktopLauncher`, **module:** `desktop`, **working directory:** `<project directory>\project_aeii\assets`

In commandline script, it's like
```$shell
cd <ParentFolder>\project_aeii\assets
java -jar <ParentFolder>\project_aeii\desktop\build\libs\desktop-1.2.0.jar net.toyknight.aeii.desktop
```
